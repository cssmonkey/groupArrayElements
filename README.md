# groupArrayElements

This is a code challenge to demonstate some small executable code.

The groupArrayElements function should:
- Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N equally sized arrays.
- Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal to the remainder

## How to get started

Install the required npm packages
```sh
npm i
```

## Run tests

The following npm script will execute unit tests written in Jest
```sh
npm test
```

## Other notes

Normally I'd use tools such as babel or TypeScript but didn't consider this a requirement for this coding challenge.

The best way to see the code in actions is to run the tests. Normally I'd consider using WebPack or Rollup to output compiled JS files but again, I didn't consider this a requirment for the exercise.
