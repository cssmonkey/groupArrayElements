# groupArrayElements

This coding challenge to demonstates some small executable code.

The groupArrayElements function should:
- Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N equally sized arrays.
- Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal to the remainder

## How to get started

Install the required npm packages
```sh
npm i
```

## Run tests

The following npm script will execute unit tests written in Jest
```sh
npm test
```

## Other notes

Normally I'd use tools such as babel or TypeScript, webpack etc but didn't consider this a requirement for this coding challenge.

The best way to see the code in action is to run the tests.
